# Changelog

Notable changes between releases. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) loosely; the project uses
0.x SemVer where minor bumps are additive feature drops and patches are
fixes.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Append-only event log** at `<storage>/.events.jsonl`. Every tool call
  records one JSON line: query/returned IDs for searches, status/scopes for
  writes, ID for shows/updates/removes, etc. Auto-rotates (gzip) when the
  active log crosses `[telemetry] max_bytes` (default 10 MB). Each event
  carries a per-process `session` id so retrieval and write streams can be
  correlated.
- **`[telemetry]` config section** with `enabled` (default `true`) and
  `max_bytes` (default `10_000_000`). `enabled = false` makes every event a
  no-op and never creates the log file.
- **Structural durability gate.** `memory_write` now runs a regex check
  against the body for transient-state markers ("currently", "today I",
  "we just", "the new", commit-SHA-like hex tokens, etc.) before dedup.
  Hits return `{status: "transient_warning", markers: [...]}` instead of
  committing. Pass `acknowledge_transient=True` to override after rephrasing
  or deciding the marker is durable in context. Overrides are recorded in
  the event log per-marker so we can compute the false-positive rate and
  trim the marker list against real traffic.
- New `bettermemory.durability` module: `TRANSIENT_PHRASE_MARKERS` (the
  canonical list, single source of truth) and `find_transient_markers()`.
- New `bettermemory.events` module: `Recorder`, `iter_events`,
  `iter_all_events`.

### Changed

- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_ADDENDUM` rewritten so the durability rule references the
  structural enforcement rather than enumerating markers. The model gets
  the principle from the prompt and the specific marker that fired from
  the tool response. `docs/system_prompt.md` updated to match.
- `build_server()` accepts an optional `recorder=` argument. When omitted,
  a `Recorder` is constructed from the resolved `Config`.
- `SessionState` now carries a stable `session_id` for the lifetime of the
  process. `state.reset()` deliberately preserves it.
